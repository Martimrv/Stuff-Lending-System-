# Stuff-Lending-System-
This is the creation, design and implementation of a Stuff Lending System. 


The general idea is that the app has a number of members that offer a number of items for lending. For every item, they get a number of credits in the system. 
Credits can be used to lend other items. Each item have a cost per day, and credits are transfered from the lender to the item owner, when a lending contract is established. The lending contract defines the time period - when the item should be picked up and returned to the owner. 
This establishes a basic economy in the system; mebers add value by adding items, and lending them to others.
